## Simplified Development Approach

### Week 1 Focus
- **Days 1-2**: Project setup and configuration
- **Days 3-5**: Design system and basic components

### Week 2 Focus
- **Days 1-3**: Molecules and organisms
- **Days 4-5**: Cart system and state management

### Week 3 Focus
- **Days 1-3**: All core pages
- **Days 4-5**: Integration and basic testing

### Week 4 Focus
- **Days 1-3**: Testing and optimization
- **Days 4-5**: Final polish and deployment

## Key Simplifications Made

1. **Reduced Timeline**: 4-5 weeks instead of 6-8 weeks
2. **Streamlined Testing**: Focus on manual testing over automated
3. **Simplified Deployment**: Use Vercel for zero-config deployment
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Stick to core Next.js + Tailwind stack
5. **Basic SEO**: Essential meta tags only
6. **Single Developer**: Optimized for solo development

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Use Next.js Image optimization and lazy loading
- **Mobile**: Test on actual devices throughout development
- **Scope**: Stick to MVP features, avoid feature creep

### Timeline Risks
- **Complexity**: Start simple, add enhancements later
- **Testing**: Manual testing sufficient for MVP
- **Deployment**: Vercel handles most complexity

## Success Criteria (Simplified)

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All pages load in <3 seconds
- [ ] Cart functionality works
- [ ] Responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Basic accessibility compliance

### Business Requirements
- [ ] Users can browse products
- [ ] Users can add to cart
- [ ] Contact information accessible
- [ ] Festival bundles featured prominently

## Immediate Next Steps

2. **This Week**: Complete foundation and basic components
3. **Next Week**: Build core functionality
4. **Week 3**: Complete all pages
5. **Week 4**: Test and deploy
